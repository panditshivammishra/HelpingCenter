# helpCenter

This project is a full-stack Help Center application. The backend is hosted on Render, and the front end is hosted on Vercel. It allows users to manage Help Center cards, including creating and retrieving them.

#####IMPORTANT 
I have created all the Apis as per the requirements mentioned in your assignment guidelines. I will make sure to build the front end as much as you specified. Thank You!
